<p>The GraphHopper GmbH is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable 
user data, except what you voluntarily give to us via email, up on registration or other direct contact from you.
We do not sell or rent this information to anyone.</p>

<h2>GraphHopper Website and Documentation</h2>
<p>For web analytics we use <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo (piwik)</a> where we do not store the full IP address but only 2 bytes like 192.168.xxx.xxx,
as well as information like your internet domain, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you 
access on GraphHopper.com. This information is collected solely for diagnostic and analytic purposes. We do not share any identifiable information about this
information at any time, unless required by law.
</p>

<p>
If you contact us via our contact form, the data is stored in our
<a href="https://centralstationcrm.com/privacy">CRM system</a> hosted in Germany.
If you contact us via email, the emails are stored at our email-provider
<a href="https://www.df.eu/int/datenschutz/">DomainFactory</a>.

<h3>GraphHopper Maps</h3>
GraphHopper Maps is part of the GraphHopper website and so the same policy
applies. Additionally, we use the default map provider
<a href="https://omniscale.com/termsofuse">Omniscale</a> where the request is processed
to provide us with map tiles.

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>We use cookies information to<br>
(i) simplify browsing our website so you do not need to re-enter user data during your visit or in subsequent visits;<br>
(ii) maintain sessions for authenticated users; and<br>
(iii) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.</p>
<p>Cookies are not used for the GraphHopper Directions API.</p>

<h2>GraphHopper Directions API</h2>
<p>For the GraphHopper Directions API we collect personal information of the customer such as name, email, registration IP,
time and company name. The purpose is to send technical emails, support
contact, privacy or term changes, newsletter (only if agreed), the obligation to prove the business nature of the
registration request and to reduce likelihood of misusage of credit card information at a later stage.
To avoid newsletter emails, you can unsubscribe via a link provided at the
end of every newsletter. If you want your account to be removed entirely, send us a message via the dashboard.
</p>
<p>
We process the API requests on rented servers from <a href="https://wiki.hetzner.de/index.php/Datenschutz-FAQ/en">Hetzner</a> hosted in Germany
and have <a href="https://www.graphhopper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dpa-2018-03-27.pdf">signed an agreement</a> with them. As the
geographic coordinates might be personal information we take special care.
</p>

<p>
Every API request is stored. We save the associated information (request body and
headers, IP, time) for a maximum of 5 weeks. We use this to identify
misusage of API tokens and to
improve performance and usability of our API.
Our customers have the choice to use a proxy to enhance the privacy of their
users.
</p>

<p>
Customers can choose between different geocoding providers. If "opencagedata"
or "nominatim" is selected, requests go to
<a href="https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/gdpr">OpenCageData</a>. If "gisgraphy" is selected, requests go to
<a href="https://www.gisgraphy.com/privacy">Gisgraphy</a>.
</p>

<p>
Customers can request their personal information as well as the deletion
of these information via dashboard message or email. Personal information like
email can be changed in the dashboard or requested via the dashboard.
</p>

<p>Payment providers can store additional information such as address and credit card number. This information is used solely for billing purposes
and to fulfill customer orders. It is collected, processed, and held in a secure environment that only authorized persons can access. Credit card information
is not stored at all and only processed via our payment provider. We use the subscription provider <a href="https://billwerk.com/">billwerk</a>
(monthly recurring invoices), the payment provider <a href="http://www.heidelpay.com/payment/">Heidelpay</a> and the
payment networks Visa, Mastercard and American Express depending on the type of credit card.</p>
<p>Passwords are stored encrypted and we take precautions to protect your information. When you exchange information via our Services, your information 
is protected online (via HTTPS, PFS and similar techniques) as well as offline due to modern and secure datacenters.
</p>

<a href="https://www.buchhaltungsbutler.de/datenschutzbestimmungen/">Buchhaltungsbutler</a>.
