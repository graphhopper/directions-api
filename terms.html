You may cancel at any time. There is no required length of time associated with using the Services,

subscription period.

We reserve the right to change our fees, but will notify you in advance of increases.
<h3>7. Modifying and Terminating our Services</h3>
GraphHopper has the right to change any service provided free of charge at any time, to make available
new services free of charge or paid-for, and to terminate the provision of free-of-charge modules.
In these cases, GraphHopper will show consideration of the legitimate interests of the Subscriber.
<h3>8. Warranty</h3>
(1) If the services provided by GraphHopper are inadequate, because their viability for contractual
use is not insignificantly impaired, GraphHopper is liable according to the legal requirements for
material and legal defects.
(2) The Subscriber is obligated to report defects to GraphHopper immediately. Warranty claims for defects
expire within one year.
(3) The Service Level Agreement (SLA) is 99.5% availability within every month.
If less than 99.5% availability (but more than 99%) is reached then a discount

For a custom packages different SLA requirements can be arranged.

The parties shall assume mutually liable in cases of intent or gross negligence for all damages caused
by them as well as their legal representatives or proxies. In cases of slight negligence, the parties
assume liability in the event of injury to life, body or health. In any other event, a party is only
liable, if they have violated a substantial contractual obligation. In these cases, the liability is
limited to the foreseeable, predictable ensuing damages. GraphHopper's liability, regardless of
culpability, pursuant to defects at the start of contract will be excluded; Section 1 and 2 remain
unaffected. Liability according to product liability law remains unaffected.
<h3>10. Limitation of liability for use free of charge</h3>
In the event that the Subscriber should suffer damages as a result of free-of-charge use of the
service (use free of charge, trial phase), GraphHopper will assume liability only in cases, where
the damages were incurred as a result of contractually agreed-upon use of the Services, and only
in cases of intent (including fraud) and gross negligence on the part of GraphHopper.
<h3>11. Online manual</h3>
GraphHopper makes an online manual for the use of the services available. GraphHopper decides at his
own discretion, whether changes to the Services necessitate an addition or revision to the online manual.
<h3>12. Use of brand names, names and logos</h3>
The Subscriber gives permission for GraphHopper to use company identifiers, names, brand names and
logos of the Subscriber ("Signs") pursuant to the following provisions in case of a package without the white label option.
GraphHopper is permitted to use Signs for the purposes of presentation and advertisement. In particular,
GraphHopper is permitted to use the Signs for the purpose of presentation and advertisement on the company
website, as well as other GraphHopper-run websites, portals, in brochures, flyers, newspapers,
magazines, for exhibitions and events of any kind. The Subscriber gives these permissions to
GraphHopper free of charge. The Subscriber may withdraw permission at any time in writing,
as long as he can claim a legitimate interest. As legitimate interests qualify in particular
insolvency, cessation of business activity, business divestiture or a legal claim by a third
party against the Subscriber with regard to the rights of use of the Signs.
<h3>13. Right of usage</h3>
Subscriber is given a single right of usage (not sub-licensable and non-transferrable) to the Services,
limited to the term of duration of this contract, pursuant to the following provisions.
The Subscriber uses the Services on GraphHopper's IT system. There is no transfer of the Software
to the Subscriber. The Services may only be used for the Subscriber's own business activity and
by his own members of staff. If GraphHopper releases new versions, updates, upgrades or other
new supplies with regard to the Services, the above-mentioned provisions will also apply to those.
The Subscriber is not entitled to rights, which have not explicitly been granted to the Subscriber
above. The Subscriber particularly does not have the right to use the Services beyond the
agreed-upon usage, or allow its use by a third party or to make the Services accessible to a
third party (the exception is the authorised use by members of staff). In particular, it is
not permitted to copy, sell, lease for a limited time, particularly not to license or lend the Services.
The Subscriber must take the necessary precautions to prevent the use of the Services by
unauthorised parties. If a breach of duty is attributable to the Subscriber, GraphHopper is entitled
to claim damages.
<h3>14. Contract term</h3>
The contractual agreement begins with the formation of contract and lasts for the contractually
agreed-upon time period. It renews automatically, according to contractual agreement, for the
respectively agreed-upon amount of time, unless one party terminates the contract in compliance
with the agreed-upon notice period. The notice shall be given in writing. An extraordinary termination
as a result of, or in connection with a breach of duty is only possible following a written warning and
within a reasonable time limit. Irrespective of the regulation set out in section 2, GraphHopper can
terminate the contract without notice, if the Subscriber is behind on the payment for two consecutive
months, or on a significant proportion of payment; or if the Subscriber, in a time period, spanning
more than two months, is behind on the payment of fees amounting to the payment of fees for two months.
<h3>15. Confidentiality</h3>
(1) The contracting parties shall enter into an agreement of non-disclosure regarding all confidential
information, which has come to their attention as part of this contractual agreement, or use it
only after obtaining written permission by the other party with a third party, regardless to
what purpose. Among the information to be treated confidentially is the information explicitly
termed confidential by the information-providing party and such information, the confidentiality
of which is implied clearly by the circumstances of their transfer. GraphHopper ought to treat
confidentially, in particular, the application data, should it become known to him.
(2) The obligations according to section 1 are void for such information or parts thereof,
where the receiving party can prove that it
<ul>
 	<li>was known to them prior to the date of receipt, or was generally accessible;</li>
 	<li>was known to the public prior to the date of receipt, or was generally accessible;</li>
 	<li>was known to the public after the date of receipt, or was made generally accessible, without the
information-receiving party being responsible for it.</li>
</ul>
Public declarations of cooperation between the two parties are only made following prior mutual
agreement.
The obligations according to section 2 extend beyond the term of the contract for an indefinite time period,
specifically, for as long as an exceptional circumstance, as listed in section 2, cannot be proven.
<h3>16. Changes to the contract terms</h3>
Unless other specific provisions have already been made, GraphHopper retains the right to change or
amend these contractual terms as follows. GraphHopper shall notify the Subscriber of the changes or
amendments in written form at least six weeks prior to their taking effect. If the Subscriber
does not agree to the changes or amendments of the contract terms, he can object to them within
a deadline of four weeks from the intended time of the changes or amendments taking effect.
The objection must be made in writing. If the Subscriber does not object, the changes and
amendments are considered approved by the Subscriber. GraphHopper shall, as part of his
notification of changes and amendments, indicate particularly the intended significance of his actions.
<h3>17. Final provision</h3>
The laws of Bavaria, Germany, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or
the Services.
All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the
courts of Munich, Germany, and you and GraphHopper consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

Headings are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
